<Title>My First Web Application</Title

<body>

This is my first web application. <br> <br>

I have a <a href="date.jsp">JSP page</a> which makes use of a Java Bean to shows date information of today. <br> <br>

I also have a <a href="RequestInfo">Servelt page</a> which shows some information about the HTTP request from a client.
